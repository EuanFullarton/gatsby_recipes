# Recipe site with GatsbyJS

Experimenting with Gatsby static site generator to display recipes and categories from the MealDB (`https://www.themealdb.com/`)

Notes:
Unfortunately the API does not return the same data for latest recipes and filtered meals, so displaying ingredients doesn't work properly when category is applied. Dessert category also mislabelled. 
   
To run:
gatsby develop

View at:
`http://localhost:8000`
